These are the research projects that I pursued as an independent study with a faculty member.

# Space Object Taxonomy
#### _May 2018 - Feburary 2020_, __Prof. Carolin Frueh, Purdue University__
<br>

**Description**: The multi-semester-long research was geared towards identifying patterns in the Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO) space objects. The patterns enabled in designing a program to autonomously classify new space objects into a taxonomy based on the 8 groups defined in the ESA [GEO Classification Report](http://www.astronomer.ru/data/0128/ESA_GEO_Classification_Report_issue_19.pdf).

**Learnings**: I learned the fundamentals of Astrodynamics to understand the orbits that the space objects were in. I used TLE data and the SGP4 model to simulate the orbits, and created functions to compute orbital elements and longitude. I developed an intuition of the orbital characteristics of the GEO objects and insights into the challenges of the space debris problem.

**Technologies used**: Python, MATLAB, Latex, CelsTrak database

**Concept learned**: Space Object Characterization, TLE, SGP4
