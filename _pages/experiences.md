The following industry experiences and assistantships, which I held during my time in graduate school at Purdue University, have been instrumental in assisting me to develop professionally.

## _Dhruva Space, India (Summer 2020)_
<hr style="border:1px solid grey">

**Description**: The 3-month long internship was geared towards programming an attitude dynamics and controls simulator in Python to simulate the attitude of CubeSat with passive magnetic attitude control (PMAC) and the dynamics coupled with orbital perturbations. The goal was to assist the hardware team to size the PMAC hardware based on the results of simulated scenarios. In addition, the code had to be designed in a modular fashion to enable the easy addition of sensor models and determination schemes, such as the Unscented Kalman Filter.

**Learnings**: I gained experience with designing and coding a simulator from the ground up using Object Oriented Programming and stakeholder (hardware team) requirements with minimal supervision. In addition, I honed my dynamics modeling skills by simulating the Earthâ€™s magnetic field and Hysteresis rod torque. A unique thing I learned was how to compartmentalize sensitive information to be able to share only selective information with another intern, who worked on developing sensor models to be added to the simulator.

**Technologies used**: Python, MATLAB, Google Cloud Platform, Asana

**Concepts learned**: Object Oriented Programming, System Design,  Dynamics Modeling, Software-in-the-loop

## _Dhruva Space, India (Summer 2019)_
<hr style="border:1px solid grey">

**Description**: The 12-week internship was centered around designing various Earth Observation and communication satellite constellations. The design focused on developing an orbit propagator to model the orbits and analyzing spatial and temporal resolutions for various coverage requirements and payload capabilities. An additional aspect was to visualize the satellite constellation around Earth and their ground track.

**Learnings**: I gained a fundamental understanding of satellite constellation design and how to set up a workflow to test multiple configurations to identify designs that can meet the requirements. I realized the importance of clear and concise technical communication to share complicated results and the power of animations to visualize the data. 

**Technologies used**: Python, MATLAB, GMAT, SaVi

**Concepts learned**: Satellite Constellation Design, Dynamics Modeling, Data Visualization

## _Indian Institude of Technology Delhi, India (Summer 2018)_
<hr style="border:2px solid grey">

**Description**: The project focused on creating an environment with a physical camera and objects, and a program to interface with the camera in real time. The objective was to rotate a camera mounted on a stepper motor and detect shapes and colors in the environment. 

**Larnings**: I learned how to control a stepper motor using SPI protocol and how to interact with a camera in real time. I realized how to design a simple environment to test basic machine learning algorithms to identify shapes and colors in it. 

**Technologies used**: MATLAB, IMU, Camera

**Concepts learned**: Create Physical Test Environments, Machine Learning
