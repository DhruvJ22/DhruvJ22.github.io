I am Dhruv Jain, an aerospace engineer fueled by critical thinking, software development, and a passion for impact, I'm eager for my next challenge! I thrive alongside driven individuals, tackling tough problems that push boundaries. I graduated from Purdue University in December 2023 with a MS thesis as a member of the [Multi-body Dynamics Research Group](https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/index.html) led by [Prof. Kathleen Howell](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=1384). 

___I am in the pursuit of my next adventure, preferrably a position that revolves around software development (focused on physcics-based simulation), data analysis and/or product management. If you would like to discuss any opportunity or connect with me then please reach out to me at dhruvj9922@gmail.com___

My graduate journey at Purdue was anything but ordinary. Beyond navigating the complexities of astrodynamics and software development, I impacted the lives of over 1500 students through diverse teaching and graduate assistant roles in Purdue's College of Engineering. My proudest contributions:

- Most Technically Challenging Contribution: [During my Master's thesis]({{site.baseurl }}/grad_research), I tackled the complexity of multi-body gravitational environments by formulating two innovative frameworks for designing transfer trajectories leveraging intricate quasi-periodic orbits.

- Most Impactful Technical Contribution: At [Dhruva Space, India](experiences.md#dhruva-space-,-india-(summer-2020)), my technical contributions directly helped fuel their success. I designed multiple satellite constellations and a non-trivial attitude dynamics and controls simulator, accelerating their path to securing seed funding and ultimately launching the Thybolt CubeSats in 2022.

- Most Non-technically Challenging Contribution: Passionate about empowering underrepresented youth, I designed and taught a [summer robotics course](experiences.md#minority-engineering-program-summer-fellow) in 2022 specifically for 11th-grade students from underrepresented backgrounds, catering to their individual learning strengths and needs.

- Most Impactful Non-technical Contribution: As the [Lead Graduate Assistant (GA)](experiences.md##summer-undergraduate-research-fellowship-graduate-assistant-surf-ga) for Purdue's Engineering Undergraduate Research Office in summer 2023, I played a pivotal role in enriching the professional development experience for 10 GAs and over 250 students from across the globe.

I enjoy working on projects that are at the intersection of __astrodynamics, numerical methods, and software engineering__. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects to obtain experience in the three areas of my interest and become a better engineer. I have gained a strong foundational understanding of astrodynamics, space systems, numerical methods, and software development through experiences in the following topics: 

- Orbit and Trajectory design in Multi-body regimes ([1]({{site.baseurl }}/grad_research), [2](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research), [3](projects.md#poliastro))
- Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics and Controls ([1](experiences.md#dhruva-space-,-india-(summer-2020)), [2](projects.md#analysis-of-motor-misalignment-jet-damping-and-mass-variation-on-a-spinning-thrusting-cubesat)) 
- Satellite Constellation Design and Analysis ([1](experiences.md#dhruva-space-india-summer-2019), [2](projects.md#senior-spacecraft-design-project-purdue-university))
- Space Object Characterization ([1](undergrad_research.md#space-object-taxonomy))
- Orbit Modeling and Analysis ([1](undergrad_research.md#aerodynamics-deorbit-experiement))
- Spacecraft Docking ([1](undergrad_research.md#spacecraft-docking-and-simulation))
- Space Systems and Sensors ([1](projects.md#senior-spacecraft-design-project-purdue-university), [2](projects.md#purdue-vibrational-instrumental-payload-for-educational-research), [3](undergrad_research.md#aerodynamics-deorbit-experiement), [4](experiences.md#indian-institude-of-technology-delhi-india-summer-2018))
- Software and Algorithm Development ([1](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research), [2](projects.md#poliastro), [3](projects.md#numerical-methods))

Furthermore, I have worked in various [assistantships and fellowship](experiences.md#assistantships--fellowship-at-purdue-univeristy) positions that have enabled me to become a better mentor, communicator, instructor, team leader, facilitator, and team player.
