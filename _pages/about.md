I am Dhruv Jain, an aerospace engineering graduate student at Purdue University, USA. I am working towards my MS thesis as a member of the Multi-body Dynamics Research Group led by Dr. Kathleen Howell. My [current research]({{site.baseurl }}/current_research) is centered around leveraging quasi-periodic orbits and their manifolds to design fuel-efficient transfer trajectories in the cislunar space. 

I enjoy working on projects that are at the intersection of astrodynamics, numerical methods, and software engineering. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects to obtain experience in the three areas of my interest and become a better engineer. I have gained a strong foundational understanding of astrodynamics, space systems, numerical methods, and software development through experiences in the following topics: 

- Orbit and Trajectory design in Multi-body regimes (CR, res github, [poliastro]({{site.baseurl }}/projets/#poliastro))
- Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics and Controls (DhruvaSpace, 507) 
- Satellite Constellation Design and Analysis (DhruvaSpace, 450, future 490)
- Space Object Characterization (Frueh)
- Orbit Modeling and Analysis (ADE)
- Spacecraft Docking (Goppert)
- Space Systems and Sensors (450, 418, ADE)

Furthermore, I have worked in various assistantships and fellowship positions that have enabled me to become a better mentor, communicator, instructor, team leader, facilitator, and team player. 

I hope to leverage all my learnings to contribute to the technological developments in robotics and space travel to sustainably improve our lives on Earth!

I am currently seeking an industry opportunity related to aerospace engineering that enables space exploration and sustainably ameliorates our lives.
