I am Dhruv Jain, an aerospace engineering graduate student at Purdue University, USA. I am working towards my MS thesis as a member of the [Multi-body Dynamics Research Group](https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/index.html) led by [Prof. Kathleen Howell](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=1384). My [current research]({{site.baseurl }}/current_research) is centered around leveraging quasi-periodic orbits and their manifolds to design fuel-efficient transfer trajectories in the cislunar space. 

__I hope to leverage all my learnings to contribute to the technological developments in robotics and space travel to sustainably improve our lives on Earth! _I am currently seeking an industry opportunity related to aerospace engineering that enables space exploration and sustainably ameliorates our lives.___

I enjoy working on projects that are at the intersection of __astrodynamics, numerical methods, and software engineering__. I have had the opportunity to work on various projects to obtain experience in the three areas of my interest and become a better engineer. I have gained a strong foundational understanding of astrodynamics, space systems, numerical methods, and software development through experiences in the following topics: 

- Orbit and Trajectory design in Multi-body regimes ([1]({{site.baseurl }}/current_research), [2](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research), [3](projects.md#poliastro))
- Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics and Controls ([1](experiences.md#dhruva-space-,-india-(summer-2020)), [2](projects.md#analysis-of-motor-misalignment-jet-damping-and-mass-variation-on-a-spinning-thrusting-cubesat)) 
- Satellite Constellation Design and Analysis ([1](experiences.md#dhruva-space-india-summer-2019), [2](projects.md#senior-spacecraft-design-project-purdue-university))
- Space Object Characterization ([1](past_research.md#space-object-taxonomy))
- Orbit Modeling and Analysis ([1](past_research.md#aerodynamics-deorbit-experiement))
- Spacecraft Docking ([1](past_research.md#spacecraft-docking-and-simulation))
- Space Systems and Sensors ([1](projects.md#senior-spacecraft-design-project-purdue-university), [2](projects.md#purdue-vibrational-instrumental-payload-for-educational-research), [3](past_research.md#aerodynamics-deorbit-experiement), [4](experiences.md#indian-institude-of-technology-delhi-india-summer-2018))
- Software and Algorithm Development ([1](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research), [2](projects.md#poliastro), [3](projects.md#numerical-methods))

Furthermore, I have worked in various [assistantships and fellowship](experiences.md#assistantships--fellowship-at-purdue-univeristy) positions that have enabled me to become a better mentor, communicator, instructor, team leader, facilitator, and team player.

# _Current Projects and Responsibilities_
<hr style="border:2px solid grey">

I am nearing the end of my Masterâ€™s journey, so I am excitedly working on finishing my thesis, which will dwell on the computation and use of quasi-periodic orbits for transfer trajectory design. In addition, I am a teaching assistant for [ENGR 162](experiences.md#engr-162-honors-introduction-to-innovation-and-the-physical-science-of-engineering-design-ii-teaching-assistant) course at Purdue.  

In order to hone my skills and further my passion for astrodynamics, numerical methods, and software engineering, I am working on contributing a part of my [research code](https://github.com/DhruvJ22/Astrodynamics_Research) to [Poliastro](projects.md#poliastro). In addition, I am collaborating with other astrodynamicists to develop [FOREST](https://github.com/mbd-astro/forest).
